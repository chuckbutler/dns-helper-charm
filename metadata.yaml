summary: Add DNS to any service

  If your service doesn't implement a DNS relationship, the subordinate helper
  will allow you to configure the records that *should* be sent from the service
  to the DNS registry. This is mostly manual, and a stop-gap for a proper DNS
  relationship implementation
